![alt text](assets/READMEfiles/colors.jpg)<br>

The colour scheme was inspired by the business itself as the artist is specialising in the black and white photography. Using Adobe Color Extract Theme function the base colours were chosen for the website, starting with #e8e8e8 as the main background colour.

The google font ‘Montserrat’ was for all text across the website as this is the font used in the business logo build in Canva by the developer. The font was imported from Google Fonts.

### Future Implementations

Overall performance of the website can be improved as some parts of the site are slowing it down, also photoshoot booking system through visible open dates on the calendar can be added in the future as unfortunately this type of addition required more technical knowledge.
